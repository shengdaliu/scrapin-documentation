I felt a sense of urgency combined with a strong commitment to change and getting the work done.\n\nOne highlight was my conversation with Bill Gates at an event hosted by Breakthrough Energy and CBRE focused on the Clean Industrial Revolution and the critical role of emerging climate technologies. Our partnership with Breakthrough Energy to decarbonize buildings, highlighted by our work with Luxwall, is a significant step forward in our net-zero commitment. \n\nWe further demonstrated the opportunity to decarbonize the built environment by honoring our work with the Javits Center. The Javits Centers' innovative microgrid featuring the largest rooftop solar array and battery storage system in Manhattan is an inspiring example of the solutions available now that can be scaled to any built environment. \n\nAnother memorable moment was speaking at Carnegie Hall during the Siemens Arts Program and Atlantik-Brücke e.V. event. It was an honor to reflect on the power of technology and culture to change the world, and to celebrate the enduring German-American friendship that has been pivotal in our journey. \n\nAs we move forward, the message is clear: partnerships are essential. No company can do this alone. The ecosystem of partners we have at #ClimateWeekNYC is crucial to delivering impact with greater speed and scale. \n\nThank you to everyone who made this week possible. Let's continue to push boundaries and take bold actions together. The future is ours to shape.  \n\n#Sustainability #NetZero #Innovation #CleanEnergy"

            Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day.
