Welcome to the ScrapIn API ðŸ‘‹

ScrapIn is a simple and powerful data provider API.

Our API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer), has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)  request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) responses, and uses standard [HTTP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes), authentication, and verbs.

## Status Codes
ScrapIn uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success and Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided.

| Code	 | Name	 | Summary |
| :---:    | :---   | :---     |
|200	|OK	| Everything worked as expected.|
|400	|Bad Request |	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
|401	|Unauthorized	|Invalid token provided in Authorization header |
|402	|Payment Required	|You don't have enough credits on your account to perform the request.  |
|403	|Forbidden	| The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.|
|429	|Too Many Requests	| The request was unacceptable due to too many request (see Rate limit bellow).|
|500	|Server Error	| The request fail due to a server error.|

## Rate limit

The ScrapIn API has a rate limit of __15 requests per second__. API rate limits are essential for managing server load and ensuring consistent and reliable service for all users. By limiting the number of requests a user can make per second, it helps prevent any single user from overloading the system, which can lead to slower response times or system outages, ensuring fair usage and availability of the service for everyone.
